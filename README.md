# GeoSpatial-Analysis

**Objective**: The project aims to analyze historical hurricane tracks and demographics to identify patterns that will inform the allocation of relief resources more effectively.

**Methodology**:

Collect data on storm trajectories, hospital locations, census demographics, and county geographics.
Process the data by extracting variables such as the number of beds in hospitals and demographic information like population size.
Create new variables, such as beds per 1000 people and population density.
Merge the datasets and plot hurricane tracks against these variables.
Focus on case studies of Hurricanes Ida (2021) and Laura (2020).

**Results**:

The research identified states commonly affected by hurricanes and assessed healthcare center availability.
It also correlated hurricane paths with population density, income levels, and healthcare resources.
The findings revealed that counties most affected by hurricanes are often under-resourced and low-income.

**Conclusion**:

The study concluded that disaster management policies need to be data-driven, prioritizing resource allocation to vulnerable, low-income areas with inadequate healthcare facilities. By focusing on community education, healthcare deployment, and infrastructure development, disaster relief efforts can become more equitable and effective. The project also developed a reusable framework for analyzing the impact of future hurricanes on U.S. counties, ensuring ongoing relevance and application of the findings in disaster management strategies.
